# Havelsan Express - NLP Challenge Solution
This project offers innovative solutions in two key areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as part of the Havelsan Express hackathon competition. The tasks include multi-class text classification and semantic search.

<br><br>

## Multi-class Text Classification Task
The goal is to accurately classify texts into 12 different categories using a provided training dataset. Evaluation is based on the F1-score, with the requirement of producing a .csv file in a specific format for assessment.

### Data
The training dataset consists of 21,091 news articles across 12 categories.

#### Approach
Participants are expected to develop a model using the provided training set to classify texts into the specified categories. Evaluation relies on the model's ability to generate the required .csv output format.

## Semantic Search Task
Participants are tasked with developing a system to find the most relevant document based on given queries' meanings and contexts. Evaluation is based on the Top-1 and Top-5 ranking criteria, with the requirement of producing a .csv output file.

### Data
The dataset comprises 8,120 Turkish web page texts obtained from Wikipedia.

#### Approach
Participants should develop a system to identify the most semantically relevant documents for given queries. Evaluation involves generating the required .csv output format.
